##1
Write a program (WAP) that will print following series upto Nth terms.
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, …….

##2
Write a program (WAP) that will print following series upto Nth terms.
1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15, 17, 19, 21, 23, 25, 27, 29, 31 …….

##3
Write a program (WAP) that will print following series upto Nth terms.
1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, …….

##4
Write a program (WAP) that will take N numbers as inputs and compute their average.
(Restriction: Without using any array)

##5
Write a program (WAP) that will take two numbers X and Y as inputs. Then it will print
the square of X and increment (if X<Y) or decrement (if X>Y) X by 1, until X reaches Y. If
and when X is equal to Y, the program prints “Reached!”

##6
Write a program (WAP) for the described scenario:
Player-1 picks a number X and Player-2 has to guess that number within N tries. For each
wrong guess by Player-2, the program prints “Wrong, N-1 Choice(s) Left!” If Player-2 at
any time successfully guesses the number, the program prints “Right, Player-2 wins!” and
terminates right away. Otherwise after the completion of N wrong tries, the program
prints “Player-1 wins!” and halts.
(Hint: Use break/continue)

##7
Write a program (WAP) that will run and show keyboard inputs until the user types an ’A’
at the keyboard.

##8
Write a program (WAP) that will reverse the digits of an input integer.

##9
Write a program (WAP) that will find the grade of N students. For each student, it will
take the marks of his/her the attendance (on 5 marks), assignment (on 10 marks), class
test (on 15 marks), midterm (on 50 marks), term final (on 100 marks). Then based on the
tables shown below, the program will output his grade.
Attendance (A) 5%
Assignments (HW) 10%
Class Tests (CT) 15%
Midterm (MT) 30%
Final (TF) 40%
Marks Letter Grade Marks Letter Grade Marks Letter Grade
90-100 A    70-73 C+    Less than 55 F
86-89 A-    66-69 C
82-85 B+    62-65 C              
78-81 B     58-61 D+
74-77 B-    55-57 D 

##10
Write a program (WAP) that will give the sum of first Nth terms for the following series.
1, -2, 3, -4, 5, -6, 7, -8, 9, -10, 11, -12, 13, -14, …….

##11
Write a program (WAP) that will calculate the result for the first Nth terms of the
following series. [In that series sum, dot sign (.) means multiplication]
1^2.2 + 2^2.3 + 3^2.4 + 4^2.5 + …….

##12
Write a program (WAP) that will print Fibonacci series upto Nth terms.
1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, …….

##13
Write a program (WAP) that will print the factorial (N!) of a given number N. Please see
the sample input output.

##14
Write a program (WAP) that will find nCr where n >= r; n and r are integers.

##15
Write a program (WAP) that will find x^y
(x to the power y) where x, y are positive integers.

##16
WAP that will find the GCD (greatest common divisor) and LCM (least common multiple)
of two positive integers.

##17
WAP that will determine whether a number is prime or not.

##18
WAP that will determine whether an integer is palindrome number or not.

##19
WAP that will calculate following mathematical function for the input of x. Use only the
series to solve the problem.
sinx=x-(x^3/3!)+(x^5/5!)-(x^7/7!)+....(inf)

##20
Write a program that takes an integer number n as input and find out the sum of the
following series up to n terms.
1 + 12 + 123 + 1234 + …….
